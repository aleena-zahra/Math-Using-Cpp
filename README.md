# Math-Using-Cpp


Welcome to the Math Using C++ repository! Here, you'll find a collection of C++ programs that cover various concepts and functionalities. Each script reflects different learning milestones and practical applications. 


# 1. Josephus Problem Simulation
- Simulates the Josephus problem, a classic algorithm where people stand in a circle, and every k-th person is eliminated until only one remains.

# 2. Maclaurin Series for Sine Calculation
- Calculates sin(x) using the Maclaurin series approximation. Interactive user input for the value of x and the number of terms in the series.

# 3. Pascal's Triangle Generator
- Generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows. Calculates and displays the sum and product of each row.

# 4. Prime Numbers Spiral Checker
- Checks whether numbers up to a specified limit, when squared, are prime. Outputs a spiral pattern indicating prime numbers.

# Usage:
- Clone the repository: `git clone [https://github.com/aleena-zahra/Math-Using-Cpp]`
- Navigate to the desired script's directory.
- Compile and run using a C++ compiler.
